# School_District_Analysis

## Project Overview
The school board has notified that the schools data shows evidence of academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered. So, the Stakeholder has asked me to do the following analysis
- Replace reading and math scores of Thomas High School to NaN
-	Repeat the school district analysis with the changed data.
